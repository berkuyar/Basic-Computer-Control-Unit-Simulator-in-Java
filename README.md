## **Project Description**
This project is a **dynamic simulator** developed using **Java and Eclipse**.  
It models the **Control Unit of a Basic Computer**, reads control functions from `denetim_fonksiyonlari.txt`, and simulates the corresponding **micro-operations**.  

The project follows **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** and includes:  
✅ **Registers (AR, PC, DR, IR)**  
✅ **Flags (S and IEN, modeled as D-type and JK flip-flops, respectively)**  
✅ **Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT)**  
✅ **Control signals**

## **Features**
✅ **Dynamic Console-Based Simulator**  
✅ **Developed with Java and Eclipse**  
✅ **Reads `denetim_fonksiyonlari.txt` for control functions**  
✅ **Displays activated micro-operations and control signals**  
✅ **Follows Object-Oriented Design (OOP)**
